It's important to note that no single financial metric can provide a cPrice/Earnings  Price/Book Value  Return on Assetsomplete picture of a stock's potential. Investors often use a combination of metrics to analyze a company's financial health, profitability, and potential for returns. Additionally, industry norms and economic context can significantly affect the ideal values for these ratios.

Looking at the context provided, we see that Return on Assets, Return on Equity, Free Cash Flow per Share, Price/Cash Flow are some of the key features that are often used to predict stock returns.

To create a new nonlinear feature correlated to the returns, we can start by taking a weighted average of these features, as they are all indicative of a company's financial health and potential for returns. We can assign different weights to each feature based on their importance in predicting stock returns.

Let's denote the features as follows:

ROA = Return on Assets
ROE = Return on Equity
FCF = Free Cash Flow per Share
PCF = Price/Cash Flow

Now, let's create a new feature using the following formula:
New Feature = (ROA * w1) + (ROE * w2) + (FCF * w3) + (PCF * w4)

For the purpose of this example, let's assume the weights as follows:
w1 = 0.3
w2 = 0.2
w3 = 0.25
w4 = 0.25

This new feature represents a combined measure of a company's efficient use of its assets and equity to generate returns, as well as its ability to generate cash flow in relation to its stock price.

Now, let's calculate the values of this new feature for each company and normalize them in the range from 0 to 1. After that, we can evaluate the correlation between the new feature and the returns to ensure it is indeed correlated to the stock returns.

Once we have the values and the correlation, we can interpret the new feature as a comprehensive measure of a company's financial performance and potential for generating stock returns. It takes into account multiple financial indicators and provides a more holistic view of a company's prospects for stock returns."
