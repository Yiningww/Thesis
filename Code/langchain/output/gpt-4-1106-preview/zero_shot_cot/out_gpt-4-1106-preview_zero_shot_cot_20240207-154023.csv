Context: 
{featuredef}
It's important to note that no single financial metric can provide a complete picture of a stock's potential. Investors often use a combination of metrics to analyze a company's financial health, profitability, and potential for returns. Additionally, industry norms and economic context can significantly affect the ideal values for these ratios.

Following are part of the data:

",2016-01-31,2016-01-31,"Price/Earnings,Price/Book Value,Return on Assets,Return on Equity ,Free Cash Flow per Share,Price/Cash Flow,Dividend Yield (%),Enterprise Value/EBIT,Enterprise Value/EBITDA,Dividend Payout Ratio (%)","['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'GOOGL', 'JNJ', 'V', 'PG', 'JPM', 'UNH', 'MA', 'LYV', 'JLL', 'TRGP', 'FTI', 'OKE', 'SON', 'DVN']","To create a new nonlinear feature that is correlated to the returns, we could combine existing features in a way that captures some aspect of investment logic or a known financial heuristic. Given the list of ratios and valuation metrics, one such heuristic is to consider the interaction between a company's profitability and valuation ratios, as investors may prefer companies with strong profitability that are not overvalued.

One possible nonlinear feature could be the product of Return on Equity (ROE) and the inverse of the Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio. ROE is a measure of profitability, while P/E is a common valuation metric. A high ROE suggests the company is effective in generating profits from shareholders' equity, whereas a low P/E ratio suggests that the company is potentially undervalued.

Here's the formula to calculate the new feature, which we'll call ""Profitable Valuation Score"" (PVS):
\[ PVS = \frac{ROE}{P/E} \]

This feature captures the efficiency with which a company generates profits relative to its valuation. A higher PVS would indicate a company has high profitability for a given valuation, which could suggest a better investment opportunity from a return perspective.

Now, let's calculate the PVS for each company in the dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Sample data calculations (assuming we have a DataFrame 'df' with columns 'Return on Equity' and 'Price/Earnings')
df['PVS'] = df['Return on Equity'] / df['Price/Earnings']

# Standardize PVS feature
scaler = StandardScaler()
df['PVS_Standardized'] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['PVS']])
```

Remember that the standardization process subtracts the mean and divides by the standard deviation for each value in the 'PVS' column.

To provide the calculated values for the PVS feature, we would need to run the above code on the entirety of the data provided, which is not feasible in this text-based format. However, you could run the suggested code on your local machine or a Python-enabled environment to obtain the standardized 'PVS' values for the dataset.

Lastly, note that this is only one possible nonlinear feature, and there may be other combinations or transformations of existing features that could also have a strong correlation with returns. Experimentation and hypothesis testing are crucial in feature engineering to determine the most relevant and informative features."
