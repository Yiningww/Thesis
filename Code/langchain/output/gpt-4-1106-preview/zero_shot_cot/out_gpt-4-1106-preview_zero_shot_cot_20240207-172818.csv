It's important to note that no single financial metric can provide a complete picture of a stock's potential. Investors often use a combination of metrics to analyze a company's financial health, profitability, and potential for returns. Additionally, industry norms and economic context can significantly affect the ideal values for these ratios.

Following are part of the data:

",2016-01-31,2016-01-31,"Price/Earnings,Price/Book Value,Return on Assets,Return on Equity ,Free Cash Flow per Share,Price/Cash Flow,Dividend Yield (%),Enterprise Value/EBIT,Enterprise Value/EBITDA,Dividend Payout Ratio (%)","['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'GOOGL', 'JNJ', 'V', 'PG', 'JPM', 'UNH', 'MA', 'LYV', 'JLL', 'TRGP', 'FTI', 'OKE', 'SON', 'DVN']","To create a nonlinear feature that correlates with returns, we should consider interactions between different financial metrics that could influence a company's stock performance. A potential nonlinear feature could involve the product of variables that individually correlate with stock returns but may have a combined effect that isn't captured by looking at them in isolation. Since dividends are a direct form of return to shareholders, and metrics like P/E, P/B, ROA, and ROE reflect a company's profitability and efficiency, we can hypothesize that a combination of these might have an impact on future returns.

Let's create a nonlinear feature where we multiply the Dividend Yield (which provides an idea of immediate returns via dividends) by the inverse of Price/Earnings (as a high P/E can indicate overvaluation) and by the Return on Equity (indicating how effectively management is using shareholders' investments to generate profits). This feature should initially capture the interplay between immediate dividend returns, valuation, and effectiveness of returns based on equity:

New Feature (NF) = Dividend Yield (%) * (1 / Price/Earnings) * Return on Equity

This new feature would mean we're looking at companies that provide a decent immediate return via dividends and are not overvalued while efficiently using shareholders' equity to generate profits. By using the inverse of P/E, we amplify the impact of lower P/E (which is typically preferable) in this calculation.

Now let's calculate this new nonlinear feature for the first three entries in your dataset for the company AAPL (just as an example):

AAPL on 2016-03-31:
NF = 1.968392 * (1 / 11.754171) * 39.063759 = 0.1671 * 39.063759 ≈ 6.532

AAPL on 2016-04-30:
NF = 2.280514 * (1 / 10.911215) * 37.901339 = 0.2090 * 37.901339 ≈ 7.914

AAPL on 2016-05-31:
NF = 2.280514 * (1 / 10.911215) * 37.901339 = 0.2090 * 37.901339 ≈ 7.914

(Note: The values are approximations for illustrative purposes)

We would continue to calculate this for each entry in the dataset for each company.

Once we have calculated this new feature across all data points, we should standardize it to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This standardization can be done using the formula:

Standardized NF = (NF - Mean(NF)) / StdDev(NF)

The values obtained after standardization can be used in further analyses to better understand their relationship with stock returns.

Keep in mind that this is a hypothetical feature, and real investment decisions would require more rigorous testing and validation of such a feature's predictive power regarding stock returns."
