It's important to note that no single financial metric can provide a complete picture of a stock's potential. Investors often use a combination of metrics to analyze a company's financial health, profitability, and potential for returns. Additionally, industry norms and economic context can significantly affect the ideal values for these ratios.

Following are part of the data:

",2016-01-31,2016-01-31,"Price/Earnings,Price/Book Value,Return on Assets,Return on Equity ,Free Cash Flow per Share,Price/Cash Flow,Dividend Yield (%),Enterprise Value/EBIT,Enterprise Value/EBITDA,Dividend Payout Ratio (%)","['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'GOOGL', 'JNJ', 'V', 'PG', 'JPM', 'UNH', 'MA', 'LYV', 'JLL', 'TRGP', 'FTI', 'OKE', 'SON', 'DVN']","To create a nonlinear feature that might be correlated with the returns of the companies, we should consider combinations and transformations of the existing features that capture more complex relationships than linear combinations. One approach could be to create a feature that reflects a company's efficiency in generating profits given its valuation and capital structure. Such a feature can be derived from existing ratios such as P/E (Price/Earnings), ROE (Return on Equity), and Dividend Yield, as they encapsulate aspects of company valuation, profitability, and shareholder return.

A potential nonlinear feature could be the ""Profit Efficiency Index"" (PEI), which combines these three metrics in a multiplicative manner to assess how efficiently the company generates profits (ROE) relative to its valuation (P/E) and the yield it offers to shareholders (Dividend Yield). We would use the natural logarithm to smooth out the influence of extreme values and to ensure the multiplicative relationship can be effectively captured even after standardization. 

The formula for PEI might be: 

PEI = ln(P/E) * ln(ROE) * ln(Dividend Yield + 1)

We add 1 to Dividend Yield to avoid taking the log of zero for companies that do not pay dividends. 

Now, computing the Profit Efficiency Index for the companies for the provided data:

```python
import numpy as np

# Example for one company (AAPL)
# Using the first row of data for demonstration, we can extract the necessary values:

def calculate_pei(p_e, roe, dividend_yield):
    return np.log(p_e) * np.log(max(roe, 0.01)) * np.log(dividend_yield + 1)  # assuming roe must be positive 0.01 to avoid log(0)

# Calculate PEI for each row and add to dataset (shown for AAPL's first data point):

pei_values = []
for index, row in aapl.iterrows():
    pei = calculate_pei(row['Price/Earnings'], row['Return on Equity'], row['Dividend Yield (%)'])
    pei_values.append(pei)

# Standardization of the PEI values:

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

pei_values = np.array(pei_values).reshape(-1, 1)  # Reshape for the scaler
pei_standardized_values = scaler.fit_transform(pei_values).flatten()  # Flatten to return to a 1D array for the dataset

# Assuming aapl dataframe contains the AAPL data and adding the standardized PEI
aapl['PEI_standardized'] = pei_standardized_values

# Show example of calculated feature and standardization for the first data point
print(f""PEI (non-standardized) for AAPL on 2016-03-31: {pei_values[0][0]}"")
print(f""PEI (standardized) for AAPL on 2016-03-31: {pei_standardized_values[0]}"")
```

This script hypothetically adds the new feature to a dataframe representing AAPL's financial dataset. The function `calculate_pei` is where the new feature is calculated. The standardization process then ensures the values of the new feature have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, making the feature more comparable across different data points.

The meaning of the Profit Efficiency Index is that it attempts to encapsulate a companyâ€™s ability to generate profits given its stock valuation and returned value to shareholders through dividends. A higher PEI would theoretically indicate that a company is more efficient at generating profits relative to these parameters.

For a complete dataset, the process would be repeated for all companies and for all rows in their respective datasets. The calculation also assumes that the P/E, ROE, and Dividend Yield values have been cleaned and are without errors or extreme outliers that could disproportionately affect the logarithmic calculations. The choice of logarithms ensures that we are capturing multiplicative interactions between the variables, recognizing that company efficiency and market evaluations often function in logarithmic scales (such as orders of magnitude in growth or ratios)."
