It's important to note that no single financial metric can provide a complete picture of a stock's potential. Investors often use a combination of metrics to analyze a company's financial health, profitability, and potential for returns. Additionally, industry norms and economic context can significantly affect the ideal values for these ratios.

Following are part of the data:

",2016-01-31,2016-01-31,"Price/Earnings,Price/Book Value,Return on Assets,Return on Equity ,Free Cash Flow per Share,Price/Cash Flow,Dividend Yield (%),Enterprise Value/EBIT,Enterprise Value/EBITDA,Dividend Payout Ratio (%)","['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'GOOGL', 'JNJ', 'V', 'PG', 'JPM', 'UNH', 'MA', 'LYV', 'JLL', 'TRGP', 'FTI', 'OKE', 'SON', 'DVN']","Creating a nonlinear feature typically involves understanding the interactions between different existing features and exploring how they might collectively influence the target variable—in this case, the returns of companies. Considering both the financial context offered and the complexity of financial markets where higher-order interactions can play a role, an interesting nonlinear feature could be derived from the notion of a risk-reward tradeoff, often considered by investors when evaluating stocks.

One possibility is to create a ""Risk-Adjusted Performance Score"" (RAPS), which aims to encapsulate a company's performance considering its volatility and growth potential. The notion here is that companies with higher returns relative to their risk and growth expectations are more desirable. This new feature would capture this interplay in a nonlinear fashion.

The formula for this new feature could be the ratio between Return on Equity (ROE) and the P/E ratio to the power of Beta. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market. While Beta is not explicitly provided in the dataset, we can infer it from the returns provided in relation to the overall market movements, which we will simply assume for the sake of this example (in reality, Beta would be calculated based on historical stock and market data).

The formula would be:
\[ RAPS = \frac{ROE}{(P/E)^\beta} \]

Here, a higher ROE is beneficial for returns, while a higher P/E ratio usually indicates overvaluation—thus, dividing ROE by P/E makes sense. Raising the P/E to the power of Beta adds volatility into the mix, penalizing this score if the company is more volatile (given that volatility is often seen as risk).

For simplicity, let's make the assumption that the Beta is 1 for all companies, turning the non-linear relation into the ratio between ROE and P/E (since anything to the power of 1 is itself). This simplification will help to demonstrate the concept without having actual Beta values.

The Risk-Adjusted Performance Score (RAPS) would thus be calculated as follows (using the given 2016-03-31 data):

For AAPL:
\[ RAPS_{AAPL} = \frac{ROE_{AAPL}}{(P/E)_{AAPL}} = \frac{39.06}{11.75} \]
For MSFT:
\[ RAPS_{MSFT} = \frac{ROE_{MSFT}}{(P/E)_{MSFT}} = \frac{12.70}{42.48} \]
... and so on for the other companies.

Now, let's calculate and standardize these RAPS values using the data from 2016-03-31:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Dummy Beta - in reality would be calculated from historical data
beta = 1

# Example data - using P/E and ROE from the first entry of AAPL and MSFT
data = {
    'AAPL': {'P/E': 11.754171, 'ROE': 39.063759},
    'MSFT': {'P/E': 42.484615, 'ROE': 12.709018},
    # Add other companies similarly...
}

# Calculate RAPS for each company
for company, metrics in data.items():
    data[company]['RAPS'] = metrics['ROE'] / (metrics['P/E']**beta)

# Create a DataFrame for scaling
df = pd.DataFrame(data).T  # Transpose to turn keys into index

# Initialize a scaler and fit_transform the RAPS values
scaler = StandardScaler()
df['RAPS_scaled'] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['RAPS']])

print(df)
```

The calculations above will output a standardized RAPS value for each company. Remember, in practice, Beta would vary across companies and time, and would be obtained from a regression of historical stock returns on market returns.

This illustrative example aims to show how a nonlinear feature that captures risk-adjusted performance could be constructed. The actual process for creating this new feature would involve a rigorous financial analysis and computational procedures that go beyond this simple explanation."
