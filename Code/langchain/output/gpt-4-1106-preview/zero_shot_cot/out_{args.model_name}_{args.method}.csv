Context: 
{featuredef}
It's important to note that no single financial metric can provide a cPrice/Earnings  Price/Book Value  Return on Assetsomplete picture of a stock's potential. Investors often use a combination of metrics to analyze a company's financial health, profitability, and potential for returns. Additionally, industry norms and economic context can significantly affect the ideal values for these ratios.

",2016-01-31,2016-01-31,"Price/Earnings,Price/Book Value,Return on Assets,Return on Equity ,Free Cash Flow per Share,Price/Cash Flow","['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'GOOGL', 'JNJ', 'V', 'PG', 'JPM']","To create a new nonlinear feature that may be correlated with stock returns, we need to consider interactions or transformations that can capture complex relationships. One such approach could be combining multiple factors to generate a ratio or index that amplifies the qualities of a profitable or high-potential company. A common method is to use polynomial features, log transformations, or interactions between existing features.

Considering the information provided, here is a potential nonlinear feature we could create:

**Feature Idea: ""Earnings Value to Growth Potential"" (EVGP) Index**

The EVGP index is an interaction that combines the Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio with the growth potential indicated by the Return on Equity (ROE) and the Free Cash Flow per Share (FCF per Share). This new feature aims to highlight companies with a reasonable valuation as per their earnings but also with solid growth potential.

How we create this feature:

We will combine P/E, ROE, and FCF per Share in a manner that higher ROE and FCF per Share values have a positive effect, while P/E has an inverse relationship.

\( EVGP = \frac{\log(FCF \ per \ Share) \times ROE}{P/E} \)

This expression uses the logarithm of FCF per Share to ensure the feature handles the scaling of cash flows and mitigates the influence of outlier values. We multiply by ROE to incorporate profitability-driven growth potential. Dividing by P/E includes the earnings valuation aspect, rewarding lower P/E values (which could indicate undervaluation).

**Normalization:**

After calculating the EVGP for each company at each date, we normalize the feature across the entire dataset so that it falls between 0 and 1. This can be done using min-max normalization:

\( EVGP_{norm} = \frac{EVGP - min(EVGP)}{max(EVGP) - min(EVGP)} \)

**Calculating Values:**

We will calculate this feature based on one of the company's data provided (AAPL):

For 2016-03-31:
\( EVGP_{AAPL} = \frac{\log(2.522972) \times 39.063759}{11.754171} \approx 3.632 \)

After calculating this value for all companies and dates, we would then apply the normalization step. However, since we only calculated this for one data point and don't have access to the full range of EVGP values, we cannot normalize this single value.

Please calculate the EVGP for all companies and dates and use the min-max formula provided to normalize the entire feature set.

**Important Note**: This new feature is an experimental index designed for this example and does not represent any standard financial metric. Before utilizing any novel financial metric in actual investment decision-making, one should thoroughly backtest the metric against historical data to validate its effectiveness at predicting stock returns. Additionally, the usefulness and correlation of this feature with returns would need to be tested empirically through statistical analysis."
