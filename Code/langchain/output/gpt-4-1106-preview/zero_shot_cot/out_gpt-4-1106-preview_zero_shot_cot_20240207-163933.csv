{featuredef}
It's important to note that no single financial metric can provide a complete picture of a stock's potential. Investors often use a combination of metrics to analyze a company's financial health, profitability, and potential for returns. Additionally, industry norms and economic context can significantly affect the ideal values for these ratios.

Following are part of the data:

Answer: {answer_str}
",2016-01-31,2016-01-31,"Price/Earnings,Price/Book Value,Return on Assets,Return on Equity ,Free Cash Flow per Share,Price/Cash Flow,Dividend Yield (%),Enterprise Value/EBIT,Enterprise Value/EBITDA,Dividend Payout Ratio (%)","['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'GOOGL', 'JNJ', 'V', 'PG', 'JPM', 'UNH', 'MA', 'LYV', 'JLL', 'TRGP', 'FTI', 'OKE', 'SON', 'DVN']","To create a new nonlinear feature that is correlated to the returns, we might want to consider interactions between existing features that can influence the potential returns. One way to create a nonlinear feature is to look for multiplicative effects as they often provide a different perspective than merely summing or averaging quantities.

Considering the context and the definitions provided, it seems that companies with a high Return on Equity (ROE) and high Free Cash Flow per Share (FCF per Share), but with a low Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio might demonstrate better profitability at a relatively lower valuation, suggesting a potential undervaluation and a good buying opportunity. Moreover, companies with lower leverage (as indicated by a lower Enterprise Value/EBITDA) could be more resilient and able to weather economic downturns, which could be favorable for their stock returns.

Based on this reasoning, we can create a new feature called ""Investment Opportunity Score"" (IOS), which combines these factors in a nonlinear manner. The IOS can be computed as follows:

\[ \text{IOS} = \left(\frac{\text{ROE} \times \text{FCF per Share}}{\text{P/E}}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{\text{Enterprise Value/EBITDA}}\right) \]

This non-linear feature attempts to encapsulate the investment attractiveness based on profitability, valuation, and leverage considerations. A higher IOS would imply a higher ROE and FCF per Share in relation to the stock's P/E ratio and a low amount of leverage, indicating a potentially undervalued investment opportunity.

Now let's calculate this new feature for all entries in the given dataset and then standardize the values:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Assuming 'data' is the DataFrame containing the financial dataset

# Calculate Investment Opportunity Score (IOS)
data['IOS'] = (data['Return on Equity'] * data['Free Cash Flow per Share'] / data['Price/Earnings']) * (1 / data['Enterprise Value/EBITDA'])

# Standardize the IOS feature
scaler = StandardScaler()
data['Standardized_IOS'] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['IOS']])
```

Please note that, in practice, the calculated IOS would need to be examined closely for its correlation to stock returns and its predictive power would need to be tested empirically using historical data analysis or other financial modeling techniques. The constructed IOS is a starting point for feature engineering, and additional adjustments may be necessary based on deeper financial analysis or the inclusion of other relevant features."
