It's important to note that no single financial metric can provide a complete picture of a stock's potential. Investors often use a combination of metrics to analyze a company's financial health, profitability, and potential for returns. Additionally, industry norms and economic context can significantly affect the ideal values for these ratios.

Following are part of the data:

",2016-01-31,2016-01-31,"Price/Earnings,Price/Book Value,Return on Assets,Return on Equity ,Free Cash Flow per Share,Price/Cash Flow,Dividend Yield (%),Enterprise Value/EBIT,Enterprise Value/EBITDA,Dividend Payout Ratio (%)","['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'GOOGL', 'JNJ', 'V', 'PG', 'JPM', 'UNH', 'MA', 'LYV', 'JLL', 'TRGP', 'FTI', 'OKE', 'SON', 'DVN']","To create a new nonlinear feature that might be correlated to the returns, we can examine combinations and transformations of the existing financial metrics that could reveal deeper insights into a company's performance and expected stock behaviour. Considering the existing features, one possible approach might involve interactions between the company's valuation measures (like P/E ratio) and its profitability measures (like ROE or ROA), as investors often look for companies that are undervalued relative to their earnings capabilities.

Here's one idea for a new feature that combines these aspects:

**Feature: Valuation to Profitability Ratio (VPR)**
- **Calculation**: 
    `VPR = (Price/Earnings) / (Return on Equity * Free Cash Flow per Share)`
- **Meaning**: 
    This ratio measures the valuation of the company's stock in relation to its profitability and ability to generate free cash flow for each unit of equity. A lower VPR may indicate that a company is potentially undervalued given its profitability and free cash generation capabilities, which could attract investors looking for growth opportunities.

Let's compute the VPR for each company and then standardize the values. To standardize, we can calculate the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the VPR across all dates and companies, then apply the following formula for each value x:

`standardized_value = (x - μ) / σ`

Here's a pseudo-code snippet for the computation:

```python
data['VPR'] = data['Price/Earnings'] / (data['Return on Equity'] * data['Free Cash Flow per Share'])

# Calculate mean and standard deviation of VPR
mean_VPR = data['VPR'].mean()
std_VPR = data['VPR'].std()

# Standardize the VPR values
data['Standardized_VPR'] = (data['VPR'] - mean_VPR) / std_VPR
```

For illustration purposes, let's compute and standardize this feature for just the first row of data for each company provided:

```python
# Example data dictionary including only the first rows for each company
example_data = {
    'AAPL': {'Price/Earnings': 11.754171, 'Return on Equity': 39.063759, 'Free Cash Flow per Share': 2.522972},
    'MSFT': {'Price/Earnings': 42.484615, 'Return on Equity': 12.709018, 'Free Cash Flow per Share': 3.031684},
    # ... similar for AMZN, GOOGL, JNJ, V, PG, JPM, UNH, MA, LYV, JLL, TRGP, FTI, OKE, SON, DVN
}

# Compute VPR and add it to the dictionary
for company, metrics in example_data.items():
    metrics['VPR'] = metrics['Price/Earnings'] / (metrics['Return on Equity'] * metrics['Free Cash Flow per Share'])

# Extract all VPR values and compute mean and standard deviation
all_vpr_values = [metrics['VPR'] for metrics in example_data.values()]
mean_VPR = sum(all_vpr_values) / len(all_vpr_values)
std_VPR = (sum((x - mean_VPR) ** 2 for x in all_vpr_values) / len(all_vpr_values)) ** 0.5

# Standardize the VPR values
for metrics in example_data.values():
    metrics['Standardized_VPR'] = (metrics['VPR'] - mean_VPR) / std_VPR

# The example_data dictionary now contains the new feature 'Standardized_VPR' for each company
```

Please note that this is a hypothetical feature designed for the purpose of illustration and its actual relevance to stock returns would need to be validated empirically through regression analysis or similar statistical tests.

Since I'm not able to run actual code here, I encourage you to compute this feature yourself in a programmable environment using the data you provided."
