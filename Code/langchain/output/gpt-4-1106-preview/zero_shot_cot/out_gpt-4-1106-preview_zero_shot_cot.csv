It's important to note that no single financial metric can provide a cPrice/Earnings  Price/Book Value  Return on Assetsomplete picture of a stock's potential. Investors often use a combination of metrics to analyze a company's financial health, profitability, and potential for returns. Additionally, industry norms and economic context can significantly affect the ideal values for these ratios.

",2016-01-31,2016-01-31,"Price/Earnings,Price/Book Value,Return on Assets,Return on Equity ,Free Cash Flow per Share,Price/Cash Flow","['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'GOOGL', 'JNJ', 'V', 'PG', 'JPM']","Creating a new nonlinear feature that could correlate to the returns involves combining the current features in a non-additive manner that might reveal interactions or non-linear relationships. Given the financial data presented, one possible nonlinear feature we could create is an ""Efficiency-Adjusted P/E Ratio."" This feature aims to consider not only the Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio but also the efficiency of the company in generating profits from its assets and equity.

Here's how we might create such a feature:
1. Compute the harmonic mean of ROA and ROE to get a single efficiency metric.
   - Efficiency Score = 2 * (ROA * ROE) / (ROA + ROE)

2. Adjust the P/E ratio by the Efficiency Score.
   - Efficiency-Adjusted P/E = P/E Ratio / Efficiency Score

This new feature, ""Efficiency-Adjusted P/E,"" will decrease when the company's efficiency (ROA and ROE) is high, adjusting the P/E ratio downward for companies that are more efficient. This effectively penalizes companies with higher P/E ratios unless they are also demonstrating high return measures. It combines the valuation metric with profitability metrics in a nonlinear fashion.

Next, we need to normalize this new feature. Normalization is done by subtracting the minimum value and then dividing by the range (maximum - minimum) for the feature. Here's the formula for the normalization:
   - Normalized Value = (Original Value - Min Value) / (Max Value - Min Value)

Now, let's calculate the Efficiency-Adjusted P/E for a single company and normalize it. Below is a calculation for the company AAPL (note: this is a simplified example, not an exhaustive calculation for all data points provided):

For the date 2016-03-31, AAPL has:
- P/E Ratio: 11.754171
- ROA: 17.892531
- ROE: 39.063759

Efficiency Score = 2 * (17.892531 * 39.063759) / (17.892531 + 39.063759)
                  = 2 * (699.211406837) / (56.95629)
                  = 24.56042452

Efficiency-Adjusted P/E = 11.754171 / 24.56042452
                        = 0.478633827

If we do the same for all the points in the dataset, and find that the minimum normalized value is, for example, 0.2, and the maximum is 2.0, we could then normalize this specific value for AAPL on 2016-03-31 as:

Normalized Efficiency-Adjusted P/E = (0.478633827 - 0.2) / (2.0 - 0.2)
                                   â‰ˆ 0.15503806

You would need to perform this process for all data points from all companies to create a full set of normalized Efficiency-Adjusted P/E ratios.

However, please note that this feature is created for illustration purposes and its actual relevance to stock returns should be validated through thorough analysis and backtesting against historical data. This would typically be done by feeding this feature into a predictive model and testing its performance in forecasting returns."
