{featuredef}
It's important to note that no single financial metric can provide a complete picture of a stock's potential. Investors often use a combination of metrics to analyze a company's financial health, profitability, and potential for returns. Additionally, industry norms and economic context can significantly affect the ideal values for these ratios.

Following are part of the data:

",2016-01-31,2016-01-31,"Price/Earnings,Price/Book Value,Return on Assets,Return on Equity ,Free Cash Flow per Share,Price/Cash Flow,Dividend Yield (%),Enterprise Value/EBIT,Enterprise Value/EBITDA,Dividend Payout Ratio (%)","['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'GOOGL', 'JNJ', 'V', 'PG', 'JPM', 'UNH', 'MA', 'LYV', 'JLL', 'TRGP', 'FTI', 'OKE', 'SON', 'DVN']","First, we consider which existing features could have a nonlinear relationship with the expected returns and create an interaction that captures such a relationship. It's reasonable to think that a company's ability to generate earnings from its assets (ROA) and its ability to manage debts and financing relative to earnings (Enterprise Value/EBITDA) would have a complex relationship with the returns. Moreover, considering a company's current valuation through a metric like the Price/Cash Flow (P/CF) ratio might add additional depth of understanding.

A potential nonlinear feature could be an interaction term that captures companies that are efficient in generating earnings from assets, have reasonable debt levels relative to their earnings, and are not overvalued in terms of cash flow. We can multiply these features to create one such interaction term.

For example, we could create the following new nonlinear feature:

**New Feature: ""Efficiency_Value_Composite"" (EVC)**

To calculate EVC at each time point, we use the equation:

EVC = (ROA^α) * (Enterprise Value/EBITDA^β) * (Price/Cash Flow^γ)

Here, α, β, and γ are exponents that adjust the weight of each feature in the composite index. For simplicity, we could initially set each of these to be -1 to invert each term, making the new feature higher for more positively perceived attributes:

EVC = (1/ROA) * (1/(Enterprise Value/EBITDA)) * (1/(Price/Cash Flow))

Such that:

- A higher ROA (making 1/ROA smaller, which is favorable) increases the EVC since more earnings from assets are positive.
- A lower Enterprise Value/EBITDA (making 1/(Enterprise Value/EBITDA) larger, which is favorable) increases the EVC, indicating the company’s earnings relative to debt and other financing tools are favorable.
- A lower Price/Cash Flow (making 1/(Price/Cash Flow) larger, which is favorable) increases the EVC, indicating that the market is not overvaluing the company’s cash flow.

The intent behind using inverted terms is to create a composite measure such that high values would, in theory, correlate with higher expected stock returns.

**Standardizing the EVC Feature:**

After calculating the EVC for all companies at each time point, we standardize it by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of all EVC values across all companies and time points:

EVC_standardized = (EVC - mean(EVC across all companies and time points)) / std(EVC across all companies and time points)

A higher standardized EVC may signal a potential for higher returns due to the interaction between efficient use of assets, reasonable debt levels, and market valuation through the cash flow perspective.

**Please note**: This is a simplistic calculation, and in actual financial analysis, more sophisticated methods including parameter optimization, additional fundamental analysis, and market context would be used to create and test new features. The choice of α, β, and γ would be typically determined through model fitting, optimization techniques, and backtesting against historical data to ensure that the proposed feature has predictive power.

Calculating EVC values for the given dataset is beyond this text-based environment, but in a programming environment like Python with pandas library, it could be done by applying the formula to the appropriate columns and performing the calculations row-wise for all companies and time points. Then, the standardization can be done using the mean and standard deviation of the calculated EVC values."
