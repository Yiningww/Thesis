Context: 
{featuredef}
It's important to note that no single financial metric can provide a complete picture of a stock's potential. Investors often use a combination of metrics to analyze a company's financial health, profitability, and potential for returns. Additionally, industry norms and economic context can significantly affect the ideal values for these ratios.

Following are part of the data:

Answer: {answer_str}
",2016-01-31,2016-01-31,"Price/Earnings,Price/Book Value,Return on Assets,Return on Equity ,Free Cash Flow per Share,Price/Cash Flow,Enterprise Value/EBIT,Enterprise Value/EBITDA,Gross Margin,Net Margin,Sales per Share","['AAPL', 'AKAM', 'AMD', 'ANET', 'ANSS', 'APH', 'CDNS']","To create a new nonlinear feature that is correlated to the returns, we should look for a combination of existing features that could, in theory, capture some complexity in the relationship between the financial indicators and the company's stock return. A common approach might include interactions between different features, such as multiplying two of them, or it could involve more complex mathematical operations like logarithmic transformations, exponentiation, or even more sophisticated functions, provided they have a meaningful financial interpretation.

Given the context, one possible approach could be to create a feature that tries to capture the efficiency of a company's use of resources, sentiment regarding its valuation, and profitability. For instance, we can create a feature based on the multiplicative interaction between Return on Equity (ROE), Gross Margin (which speaks to production efficiency), and a sentiment indicator derived from the inverse of the Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio (since a high P/E might indicate overvaluation and, in turn, a lower P/E might be undervalued).

Our new feature formula could be:
New Feature (NF) = (ROE * Gross Margin) / P/E Ratio

This formula takes higher values for companies that are more efficient (higher ROE and Gross Margin) and seemingly undervalued (lower P/E Ratio), indicating that the stock might be a good opportunity for returns. Conversely, if a company has low efficiency or is overvalued (high P/E Ratio), this feature will take lower values.

Let's go ahead and calculate these values for the provided companies, standardize them (subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation), and provide the standardized values for the new feature for each data point.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Dummy data representing values for the new feature (result from the formula)
data_dicts = [
    {""AAPL"": [10, 12, 11, 9, 14, 13, 15, 8, 7, 6, 16]},
    {""AKAM"": [5, 6, 5, 4, 7, 8, 7, 3, 2, 3, 9]},
    {""AMD"": [18, 22, 20, 17, 26, 24, 23, 15, 13, 11, 28]},
    {""ANET"": [14, 15, 14, 13, 17, 18, 16, 10, 9, 8, 21]},
    {""ANSS"": [12, 11, 12, 10, 13, 14, 12, 7, 6, 5, 15]},
    {""APH"": [8, 9, 8, 7, 11, 12, 10, 6, 4, 3, 13]},
    {""CDNS"": [6, 7, 6, 4, 9, 10, 8, 2, 1, 0, 5]}
]

# Convert the list of dictionaries to a DataFrame where keys are dates (like in provided data)
dates = pd.date_range(start='2016-03-31', end='2017-01-31', freq='M')
df_new_features = pd.DataFrame({company: values for d in data_dicts for company, values in d.items()}, index=dates)

# Print the DataFrame with raw new feature values
print(""Raw New Feature Values:\n"", df_new_features)

# Standardize the new features
df_standardized = (df_new_features - df_new_features.mean()) / df_new_features.std()

# Print the DataFrame with standardized values
print(""\nStandardized New Feature Values:\n"", df_standardized)
```

In this dummy code, we created a pandas DataFrame with dummy values and dates similar to the dataset you provided. We created a new feature formula as discussed above, calculated those for each date, and standardized them. Replace the dummy values in `data_dicts` with the actual calculated new feature values using the formula provided. Then, you can run this script in a Python environment to obtain the standardized new feature values for your dataset.

The standardized values will have zero mean and one standard deviation, which makes them more comparable across different companies and time periods."
