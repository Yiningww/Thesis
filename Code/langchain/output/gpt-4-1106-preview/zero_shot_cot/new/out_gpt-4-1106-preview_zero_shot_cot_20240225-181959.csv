It's important to note that no single financial metric can provide a complete picture of a stock's potential. Investors often use a combination of metrics to analyze a company's financial health, profitability, and potential for returns. Additionally, industry norms and economic context can significantly affect the ideal values for these ratios.

Following are part of the data:

",2016-01-31,2016-01-31,"Price/Earnings,Price/Book Value,Return on Assets,Return on Equity ,Free Cash Flow per Share,Price/Cash Flow,Enterprise Value/EBIT,Enterprise Value/EBITDA,Gross Margin,Net Margin,Sales per Share","['AAPL', 'AKAM', 'AMD', 'ANET', 'ANSS', 'APH', 'CDNS']","Creating a nonlinear feature requires us to think about how the provided metrics could interact with each other in a way that may be predictive of stock returns. Since stock returns could be influenced by various combinations of company financial health indicators, we'll aim to integrate multiple metrics into our new feature.

Considering the given definitions, several indicators reflect profitability (ROA, ROE, Net Margin), while others provide insights into valuation (P/E, P/B, P/CF, EV/EBIT, EV/EBITDA) and efficiency (Gross Margin, Sales per Share, Free Cash Flow per Share).

One possible nonlinear feature could be a composite score that captures both the efficiency of asset utilization and the growth potential of a company, calculated using a multiplicative formula that balances different aspects represented by ratios. We could call this a ""Growth Efficiency Composite"" (GEC).

To ensure we're not simply creating a linear combination, we can use logarithmic and exponential transformations, which are common methods of introducing nonlinearity.

Here's how the ""Growth Efficiency Composite"" (GEC) is constructed:

- We focus on efficiency and growth potential by considering Gross Margin (as a measure of production efficiency) and Free Cash Flow per Share (as an indirect measure of growth potential).
- We apply a logarithmic transformation to Free Cash Flow per Share to reduce the scale effect given its wide range across different companies.
- We then utilize ROE as a measure of financial effectiveness, taking its reciprocal to balance the measure (since a higher ROE is preferred).
- We also look at the P/E ratio to account for market expectations of growth. We use the exponential of the negative value to assign higher weights to lower P/Es (bearing in mind that a lower P/E is preferred).
- Finally, we take the product of these items to get the new feature.

The formula for GEC would be:

\( GEC = (\log(\text{Free Cash Flow per Share} + c) \times \frac{1}{\text{Return on Equity}} \times e^{-\text{Price/Earnings}} \times \text{Gross Margin} \)

Here, ""c"" is a small constant (like 1) added to the Free Cash Flow per Share to avoid log(0) for companies with a zero or negative value.

Now, let's compute the GEC for the given data sample for the company AAPL in the date range from 2016-03-31 to 2017-01-31:

First, letâ€™s define c = 1 for our calculations.

For the date 2016-03-31:

\( GEC = \log(2.522972 + 1) \times \frac{1}{39.063759} \times e^{-11.754171} \times 38.315222 \)

Repeat this calculation for each date and for each company in the provided data. Once we have the GEC for all given data points, we need to standardize these values. We standardize by subtracting the mean of the GEC for all data points and dividing by the standard deviation:

\( GEC_{standardized} = \frac{GEC - \text{mean}(GEC)}{\text{std}(GEC)} \)

Apply this formula using the calculated GEC values to get the standardized GEC.

Finally, the interpretation of the ""Growth Efficiency Composite"" (GEC) would be:
- A higher GEC value indicates a balance of higher profitability, efficiency, higher cash flow, and market undervaluation, which hypothetically could correlate with higher expected stock returns.
- A lower GEC value suggests a combination of lower efficiency, lower profitability, lower cash flow, or overvaluation in the market.

Implementing the above calculations would require a computational environment and thus is beyond the scope of this platform. However, as a next step, you would want to verify the correlation between GEC and returns using statistical analysis tools like Pearson correlation coefficient or Spearman's rank correlation in a programming environment such as Python with packages like `pandas` and `scipy`.

Remember that this is a hypothesized feature, and its actual predictive power should be validated with thorough backtesting on historical data and considering various market conditions."
