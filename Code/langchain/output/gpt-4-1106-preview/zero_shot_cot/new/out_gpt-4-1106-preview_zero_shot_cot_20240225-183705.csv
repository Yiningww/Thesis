It's important to note that no single financial metric can provide a complete picture of a stock's potential. Investors often use a combination of metrics to analyze a company's financial health, profitability, and potential for returns. Additionally, industry norms and economic context can significantly affect the ideal values for these ratios.

Following are part of the data:

",2016-01-31,2016-01-31,"Price/Earnings,Price/Book Value,Return on Assets,Return on Equity ,Free Cash Flow per Share,Price/Cash Flow,Enterprise Value/EBIT,Enterprise Value/EBITDA,Gross Margin,Net Margin,Sales per Share","['AAPL', 'AKAM', 'AMD', 'ANET', 'ANSS', 'APH', 'CDNS']","Creating a new nonlinear feature involves combining existing features in a nonlinear way that could potentially reveal more complex relationships with the stock returns. Given the provided context and the nature of the financial ratios, a possible nonlinear feature might be one that captures a combination of profitability, valuation, and growth potential.

One such feature could be an ""Investment Quality Score"" that multiplies profitability ratios by inversely related valuation ratios, adjusted by growth evidence. For simplicity, let's utilize the following:

- Profitability: We'll use Return on Equity (ROE), a measure of financial efficiency and profitability relative to shareholder's equity.
- Valuation: We will use the inverse of the Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio and the inverse of Price/Book Value (P/B) Ratio since lower values of these ratios are generally preferred and indicate potential undervaluation.
- Growth: Sales per Share could serve as a proxy for a company's growth potential. We'll transform this feature through a logarithm to moderate extreme values and emphasize relative changes in sales.

Our new feature, therefore, could be defined as:

Investment Quality Score (IQS) = (ROE * (1 / P/E) * (1 / P/B)) * log(Sales per Share)

This feature aims to score companies higher if they have high profitability, lower valuation ratios, and evidence of sustainable sales growth. 

Now, let's calculate the values of this hypothetical feature for each company on each date. We'll only calculate the scores for the first two dates of the AAPL company as an example due to space constraints. Following these calculations, we'll need to standardize the newly created feature across all the data, which is often done by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

For AAPL on 2016-03-31:
IQS = (39.063759 * (1 / 11.754171) * (1 / 4.437537)) * log(10.147655)
IQS ≈ (3.3220 * 0.2261) * 2.318
IQS ≈ 0.1753

For AAPL on 2016-04-30:
IQS = (37.901339 * (1 / 10.911215) * (1 / 3.980702)) * log(9.974728)
IQS ≈ (3.4743 * 0.2514) * 2.300
IQS ≈ 0.2002

Now, let's standardize these values. Imagine these two IQS scores are part of a larger set. The mean (μ) of this set is 0.188 and the standard deviation (σ) is 0.0126.

Standardized IQS for 2016-03-31 = (0.1753 - 0.188) / 0.0126 ≈ -1.0079
Standardized IQS for 2016-04-30 = (0.2002 - 0.188) / 0.0126 ≈ 0.9683

These standardized scores now have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, allowing us to compare them more easily across all companies and dates.

In practice, you would calculate the IQS for all dates and companies, then standardize these values as a whole. You could then analyze the correlation of these standardized IQS values with the returns to validate if your new feature is indeed predicting stock returns as intended. If IQS shows promise, it could be incorporated into quantitative models for stock evaluation or investment decision-making processes."
