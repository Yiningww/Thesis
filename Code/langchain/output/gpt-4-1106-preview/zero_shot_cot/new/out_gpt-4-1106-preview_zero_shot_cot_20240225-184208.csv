It's important to note that no single financial metric can provide a complete picture of a stock's potential. Investors often use a combination of metrics to analyze a company's financial health, profitability, and potential for returns. Additionally, industry norms and economic context can significantly affect the ideal values for these ratios.

Following are part of the data:

",2016-01-31,2016-01-31,"Price/Earnings,Price/Book Value,Return on Assets,Return on Equity ,Free Cash Flow per Share,Price/Cash Flow,Enterprise Value/EBITDA,Gross Margin,Net Margin,Sales per Share","['AAPL', 'AKAM', 'AMD', 'ANET', 'ANSS', 'APH', 'CDNS']","Creating a non-linear feature from the existing financial data involves combining multiple features in a way that captures a non-linear relationship with the expected return on the stock. Such features often represent complex interactions or compound metrics that might be more closely associated with stock performance than any individual feature.

One potential non-linear feature we can create is a ""Financial Health and Growth Score"" (FHGS), which aims to capture both the profitability and efficiency of the company, as well as its ability to grow earnings over time. We will use a mix of profitability ratios (like Net Margin and ROE), efficiency ratios (like ROA), and growth indicators (like FCF per Share) combined in a non-linear manner:

\[ FHGS = \sqrt{\left(\frac{ROE \times ROA}{P/E}\right)} + \log(FCF \text{ per Share}) \times \text{Gross Margin} \]

This metric proposes that the combination of high ROE and ROA relative to the P/E ratio suggests a company has healthy profits and asset efficiency that isn't yet fully reflected in its price. Additionally, strong FCF per share with a high gross margin implies good cash generation capabilities with efficient production, which is essential for growth. By taking the square root and logarithm, we ensure that the relationship is non-linear and that the extreme values are contained, reducing the chance of any one component disproportionately impacting the score.

To illustrate how this new feature would be calculated using the available data, let's calculate it for AAPL and AKAM for the date 2016-03-31 (the new feature values are unstandardized):

For AAPL on 2016-03-31:
\[ FHGS_{\text{AAPL}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{39.063759 \times 17.892531}{11.754171}\right)} + \log(2.522972) \times 38.315222 \approx 47.47 + 0.927 \times 38.315222 \approx 83.12 \]

For AKAM on 2016-03-31:
\[ FHGS_{\text{AKAM}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{10.451327 \times 7.796624}{31.395480}\right)} + \log(2.615797) \times 62.641464 \approx 5.5 + 0.961 \times 62.641464 \approx 65.23 \]

Now, to standardize (scale) the new FHGS feature across all companies and dates, you would use the following formula for each individual FHGS value `x`:

\[ \text{Standardized FHGS} = \frac{x - \text{mean}(FHGS)}{\text{std}(FHGS)} \]

where `mean(FHGS)` is the average of the FHGS values over all companies and dates, and `std(FHGS)` is the standard deviation of the FHGS values over all companies and dates.

Due to the length of the dataset and the need for computations across multiple dates and companies, the standardization process would typically be carried out in a software environment such as Python or R using libraries designed for statistical computation.

Keep in mind that creating a feature like FHGS is a hypothesis that this composite metric correlates with stock returns. The efficacy of this metric should be verified with regression analysis or other statistical tests against historic returns to ensure it truly has predictive value."
