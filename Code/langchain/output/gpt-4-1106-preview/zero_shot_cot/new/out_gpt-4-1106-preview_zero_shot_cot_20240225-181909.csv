{featuredef}
It's important to note that no single financial metric can provide a complete picture of a stock's potential. Investors often use a combination of metrics to analyze a company's financial health, profitability, and potential for returns. Additionally, industry norms and economic context can significantly affect the ideal values for these ratios.

Following are part of the data:

I'll propose a new feature creation based on the financial concepts provided.

**New Feature Creation: ""Profitability Investment Ratio (PIR)""**

**Definition:**
PIR combines several aspects of a company's financial health to provide a holistic picture of how effective the company is at generating profit while considering how much investors are paying for that profitability. Since the calculation of PIR involves multiplication and division (which are nonlinear operations), the resulting feature is inherently nonlinear. The PIR embraces aspects of profitability, investment valuation, and efficiency.

**Formula:**
\[ \text{PIR} = \left( \text{ROE} \times \text{ROA} \times \text{FCF per Share} \right) \div \left( \text{P/E} \times \text{P/B} \times \text{P/CF} \right) \]

Here's the reasoning for why each component is used:
- We multiply **Return on Equity (ROE)** and **Return on Assets (ROA)** as they both reflect profitability, but from slightly different perspectives (equity vs. assets). A higher product of the two means the company is profitable considering both its equity and its assets.
- **Free Cash Flow per Share (FCF per Share)** is included as it indicates how much cash is available for additional investments or shareholder returns, which is a strong indicator of company health.
- We divide by the product of **Price/Earnings (P/E)**, **Price/Book (P/B)**, and **Price/Cash Flow (P/CF)** as these ratios capture how much investors are paying for a slice of company earnings, book value, and cash flow respectively. A lower product of these ratios would typically be preferred, indicating that the investor is not overpaying.

PIR gives a sense of 'bang for buck' in terms of profitability; a higher PIR suggests that for the price you are paying (considering market valuation metrics), you are getting a more profitable and cash-efficient company.

**Calculation:**

To calculate PIR for each company in your dataset, we would use their respective feature numbers:

For example, the PIR for **AAPL** on 2016-03-31 would be calculated as:

\[ \text{PIR}_{\text{AAPL}, \text{2016-03-31}} = \left( 39.063759 \times 17.892531 \times 2.522972 \right) \div \left( 11.754171 \times 4.437537 \times 8.670686 \right) \]

...and similarly for other companies for each date given.

**Standardization:**

Once we calculate PIR for each entry, we want to standardize these values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. You typically perform this through the following formula:

\[ \text{Z-Score of a value} = \frac{\text{Value} - \text{mean(Value)}}{\text{std(Value)}} \]

This calculation requires iterating through the dataset, computing the mean and the standard deviation across all PIR values, and then applying the formula for each PIR.

As this calculation can be quite extensive and depends on the software or method you are using (e.g., Excel, Python pandas, R, etc.), I will refrain from providing detailed calculations. But this is the general approach you would take to create and standardize the proposed nonlinear feature.

Please note that creating features in stock return prediction is complex and often involves a trial-and-error approach. Many external factors can influence stock returns, and the feature may require further validation and testing before it is used in a predictive model."
