{featuredef}
It's important to note that no single financial metric can provide a complete picture of a stock's potential. Investors often use a combination of metrics to analyze a company's financial health, profitability, and potential for returns. Additionally, industry norms and economic context can significantly affect the ideal values for these ratios.

Following are part of the data:

Nonlinear features can capture complex interactions between variables that are not possible to model with a simple linear combination.

Given the financial metrics provided, we want to construct a feature that incorporates interactions between these metrics, potentially revealing how combinations of financial health, profitability, and valuation metrics might relate to stock returns.

I propose creating a feature that we'll call ""FinancialHealthScore,"" which likely would capture a firm's overall financial health status based on the provided features. Here's a schematic way of creating this score:

1. Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA) both indicate profitability and efficiency. They could interact in a way where companies with both high ROE and high ROA are considered very robust. We could model this interaction by multiplying the two metrics.

2. P/E Ratio, P/B Ratio, and P/CF Ratio assess the market's valuation of the company's earnings, book value, and cash flow, respectively. A harmonious relationship between good valuation and profitability might involve not just a simple multiplication but perhaps a more complex interaction (e.g., geometric mean) that balances these valuation measures with profitability.

3. Free Cash Flow per Share (FCF per Share) is a measure of liquidity which is particularly important for paying dividends or reinvesting. This should positively interact with Dividend Yield, as companies with high FCF per Share and respectful Dividend Yield are likely attending to their investors' needs without risking their growth potential.

4. Enterprise Value/EBITDA is widely used for valuation comparisons. Since a lower ratio is generally preferred, we could incorporate its inverse in our interaction to emphasize the case where lower Enterprise Value/EBITDA accompanies better profitability metrics.

5. Lastly, to model nonlinearity further, we could incorporate squared or cubic terms of certain ratios that are particularly important, like the P/E ratio, to capture the diminishing or accelerating effects on the returns as these ratios increase.

So, our FinancialHealthScore might look something like this:

```
FinancialHealthScore = (ROE * ROA) * (sqrt(P/E * P/B * P/CF)) * (FCF per Share * Dividend Yield) * (1 / Enterprise Value/EBITDA) + (P/E)^2
```

After creating this feature, to prepare it for use in any analysis or models and ensure equal weighting of all features, we would then standardize it by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation (z-score normalization).

Now to compute this feature for each company and standardize the feature, I would first need to run the appropriate calculations based on the provided data. Unfortunately, as an AI text-based assistant developed by OpenAI and with the current capabilities up until September 2021, I cannot process the data for you. But, provided with a data analysis tool, here are the high-level steps you would follow to complete the calculations:

1. Apply the formula to calculate the FinancialHealthScore for each row in the dataset.
2. Standardize the FinancialHealthScore by computing the mean and standard deviation and then applying z-score normalization.

Please use a data processing tool (like Python's pandas and scikit-learn libraries) to complete these calculations on your dataset."
