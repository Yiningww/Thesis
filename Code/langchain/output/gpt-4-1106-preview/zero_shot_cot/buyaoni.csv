some features(included in the context) and their expected returns. I will also give you the descriptions of these features"".

Context: 
{featuredef}
It's important to note that no single financial metric can provide a complete picture of a stock's potential. Investors often use a combination of metrics to analyze a company's financial health, profitability, and potential for returns. Additionally, industry norms and economic context can significantly affect the ideal values for these ratios.

Following are part of the data:

Given the nature of financial data, interaction between multiples and profitability ratios could represent such a complex relationship, as they might embody investor expectations about the future growth and earnings potential of a company. 

**Feature Idea:**
A feature that captures the interaction between the company's valuation multiples (like P/E, P/B) and its profitability (like ROA, ROE) could be significant. Specifically, the P/E ratio can reflect growth expectations, while ROE indicates how effectively a company uses equity. Their interaction may indicate how growth expectations align with actual performance.

**Feature Creation:**
The new feature could be the product of normalized P/E ratio and normalized ROE. Normalizing these features ensures that they are on the same scale, allowing for a meaningful interaction term which is standardized.

**Standardization:**
Before creating the feature, each component should first be standardized, as they might have different scales. For each feature, the standardization transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The formula for standardization is:

`z = (x - μ) / σ`

Where:
- `z` is the standardized value
- `x` is the original value
- `μ` is the mean of the feature values
- `σ` is the standard deviation of the feature values

For each company and date, we'd calculate:

`P/E standardized = (P/E ratio - Mean of P/E) / Standard Deviation of P/E`
`ROE standardized = (ROE - Mean of ROE) / Standard Deviation of ROE`

Then we create the new feature as the product:

`Nonlinear Feature = P/E standardized * ROE standardized`

This new feature would represent the interaction between market valuation and return on equity, potentially capturing the investors' assessment of whether the stock's performance justifies its valuation in terms of earnings.

Let's calculate this new feature for the AAPL dataset as an example:

**Step 1 - Standardize the P/E ratio and ROE:**

First, we need the mean and standard deviation of P/E and ROE across all dates provided for AAPL.

From the provided data, for simplification, let's assume that we have precalculated the mean and standard deviation values (in reality, these would be the mean and SD of the actual historical data preceding each point):

```
Mean P/E (AAPL): 20
SD P/E (AAPL): 10
Mean ROE (AAPL): 40
SD ROE (AAPL): 10
```

Here's the calculation for the first date (2016-03-31):
```
P/E standardized (2016-03-31) = (11.754171 - 20) / 10 = -0.824583
ROE standardized (2016-03-31) = (39.063759 - 40) / 10 = -0.093624
```

**Step 2 - Calculate the new nonlinear feature:**

```
New Feature (2016-03-31) = -0.824583 * -0.093624 ≈ 0.077221
```

This calculation has to be performed for all dates for AAPL, and similarly for other companies. Remember that this is just an example using arbitrary mean and SD values. The actual implementation would involve all historical data points for each company to calculate the mean and SD used for standardization.

**Step 3 - Standardize the new feature:**

Finally, we standardize the newly created feature:

```
Mean of New Feature (AAPL) = [mean of new feature values]
SD of New Feature (AAPL) = [standard deviation of new feature values]

New Feature Standardized (2016-03-31) = (New Feature (2016-03-31) - Mean of New Feature) / SD of New Feature
```

This standardized interaction feature can now be used in further analysis or model building, where we might discover a correlation with stock returns which could hint at nonlinear dynamics in how investors value companies based on earnings and equity effectiveness."
